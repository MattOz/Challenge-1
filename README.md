Code Refactor Challange

In this challenge I refactored existing code which consisted of the following enhancements:

1. Improved accessibility to ensure that people with disabilities can access the website using video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. This was done by changing non-semantic elements to semantic elements, organizing the elements into a logical structure, placing header elements in sequential order, adding a descriptive title to the page, and adding descriptive alt attributes to all image elements. This helps the website rank higher in search engines and could potentially help avoid litigation from people who could not previously access the website. 

2. Increased efficiency of css code by consolidating repetitive selectors and properties. I also re-organized them to follow the semantic structure of html elements. Lastly, I added comments on all css code to describle how it changes the styling of the website.
